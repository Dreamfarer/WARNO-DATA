## About WARNO
WARNO is the latest addition to the renowned French studio Eugen Systems' portfolio of real-time tactics games. Available as an Early Access title on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1611600/WARNO/), WARNO emerges as the spiritual successor to the acclaimed Wargame series. It features hundreds of the Cold War era's most iconic units from NATO and the Warsaw Pact, offering an immersive tactical experience.

## About WARNO-DATA
In WARNO, game behaviour and unit data is stored within Eugen Systems' proprietary .ndf files. While Eugen Systems provides a brief [modding manual](https://github.com/Perytron/WARNO-DATA/blob/main/docs/Modding%20Manual.pdf) and an [.ndf reference guide](https://github.com/Perytron/WARNO-DATA/blob/main/docs/NDF%20Reference%20Manual.pdf), outlining the file format, it lacks explanations of the contained data, which is distributed across thousands of .ndf files.

**WARNO-DATA** aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive wiki. It meticulously documents every key property of the most important .ndf files and explains core game mechanics, including but not limited to damage and accuracy calculations.

## Official Wiki
The official **WARNO-DATA** wiki is accessible [here](https://github.com/Perytron/WARNO-DATA/wiki) on GitHub.

[Data Dictionary](https://github.com/Perytron/WARNO-DATA/wiki/Data-Dictionary)\

[In-Depth Guide to Game Mechanics](https://github.com/Perytron/WARNO-DATA/wiki/In-Depth-Guide)\
